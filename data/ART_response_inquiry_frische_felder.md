**Tape Products (Product IDs: 50-100, 50-101, 50-102)**
1a. Are any of your tape products free of PFAS? Please provide a PFAS declaration or equivalent confirmation for each product.

1b. Can you provide verified carbon footprint data (EPD or equivalent) for each tape product?

1c. For tesapack ECO & ULTRA STRONG (50-102): The tesa website states this product is on a path to "carbon neutrality." Is this claim independently verified? If so, please provide the verification certificate.

**Cardboard Packaging (Product ID: 11-101)**
2a. Is the Grupak corrugated cardboard packaging FSC certified? If yes, please provide the FSC certificate number so we can verify it at info.fsc.org.

Dear Ms. Keller,

Thank you for your inquiry and for the detailed context. We appreciate your diligence. Please find our responses below.

### Response to Section 1: Tape Products

**1a. PFAS declarations:**
We have reviewed the available technical documentation for our tape products. Unfortunately, we do not yet hold PFAS declarations from our tape suppliers. We have initiated formal PFAS declaration requests with all tape suppliers. We will forward declarations as they are received. We regret we cannot confirm PFAS-free status at this time.

**1b. Carbon footprint data for tape products:**
- Product 50-100 (IPG Hot Melt Tape): **EPD available.** Third-party verified EPD on file. We will attach this document to our response.
- Product 50-101 (IPG Water-Activated Tape): **EPD available.** Third-party verified EPD on file. We will attach this document to our response.
- Product 50-102 (Tesa tesapack ECO): **No EPD available.** Tesa's sustainability brochure references a 68% CO₂ reduction versus their 2019 baseline conventional product, but this is based on an internal comparative assessment and has not been independently verified through an ISO 14044 lifecycle assessment. We cannot provide an EPD for this product at this time.

**1c. Carbon neutrality claim for tesapack ECO (50-102):**

### Response to Section 2: Cardboard Packaging
