    "\n",
    "### The Scenario\n",
    "**PrimePack AG** buys packaging materials (pallets, cardboard boxes, tape) from multiple suppliers. Sustainability claims are increasingly scrutinised by customers and regulators. Employees need to answer questions like:\n",
    "> *\"What is the GWP of the Logypal 1 pallet, and is the figure verified?\"*  \n",
    "> *\"Can we tell a customer that the tesa tape is PFAS-free?\"*  \n",
    "> *\"Which of our suppliers have a certified EPD?\"*\n",

    "\n",
    "| Problem | Why It Matters |\n",
    "|---|---|\n",
    "| **No product knowledge** | LLMs know nothing about Logypal 1, PrimePack's specific portfolio, or the individual supplier documents. |\n",
    "| **Hallucination** | When asked about unknown products the LLM invents plausible-sounding but false figures. |\n",
    "| **No evidence trail** | Even when correct, a raw LLM answer cannot be traced back to a source document. |\n",
    "\n",
    "### The RAG Solution\n",

    "```\n",
    " Documents ──► Chunker ──► Embedder ──► Vector DB\n",

    "                                                               LLM + Prompt\n",

    "The LLM only sees documents that are **actually in the corpus**. The answer can be traced to specific source chunks. If the corpus does not contain the answer, the LLM is instructed to say so.\n",

    "RAG shifts the problem from hallucination to **retrieval quality**. If the right chunk is not retrieved, the answer will still be wrong (or absent). The later feature tracks address exactly this: better chunking, better retrieval, and better output structure."

    "## 2. Core Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "### Chunks\n",
    "\n",
    "A **chunk** is a short excerpt from a source document, a section of a PDF, one sheet of a spreadsheet, or one heading-delimited paragraph of a Markdown file. Chunks are the unit of indexing and retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Embeddings\n",
    "An **embedding** converts text to a dense numeric vector (e.g. 384 dimensions). Semantically similar texts produce similar vectors. Here we use `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`, a compact local model that runs without an API key.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vector Store (ChromaDB)\n",
    "A **vector store** persists chunk embeddings on disk and supports approximate nearest-neighbour search. Given a query embedding, it returns the `top_k` most similar chunks in milliseconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Retriever\n",
    "A **retriever** wraps a vector store and exposes a single `retrieve(query)` method. The baseline uses a `VectorStoreRetriever` with `top_k=5`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### RAG Agent\n",
    "The **RAG agent** combines a retriever and an LLM. Its `answer()` method:\n",
    "1. Embeds the query\n",
    "2. Retrieves the top-k chunks\n",
    "3. Formats chunks as XML `<source>` tags in the prompt\n",

L2 makes no such assumption, making it the safer general default. ChromaDB defaults to L2 because it's simpler to compute and works even if vector magnitudes vary.
